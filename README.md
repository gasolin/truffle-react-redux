# Truffle-React-Redux

[![travis](https://travis-ci.org/gasolin/truffle-react-redux.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gasolin/truffle-react-redux) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ðŸ’µ-Tip_Me-brightgreen.svg)](https://gitcoin.co/tip?username=gasolin)


The `truffle-react-redux` provide the template(box) for your next dapp with React (and Redux, Route, Internationalization). The template separate the concern of `contracts` and `web` frontend as sub projects and include glue scripts to bridge the both sides.

## Installation

1. Install `Truffle` and `Lerna` globally.
    ```sh
    npm install -g truffle lerna
    ```

2. Download the box. This also takes care of installing the necessary dependencies.
    ```sh
    truffle unbox gasolin/truffle-react-redux
    ```

3. (Done automatically after unbox) Glue script can help you to install `contracts/` and `web/` project dependencies at once via [lerna bootstrap](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#bootstrap)

    ```sh
    npm run bootstrap

    # or you can install dependency modules in sub projects via separate commands
    cd contracts && npm install
    cd ../web && npm install
    ```


## Contracts development

Enter `contracts/` folder

1. Run the development console.
    ```sh
    truffle develop
    ```

2. Compile and migrate the smart contracts. Note inside the development console we don't preface commands with `truffle`. Smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated.
    ```sh
    compile
    migrate

    # If outside the development console..
    npm run build
    ```

3. Glue scripts can copy compiled JSON files into `web/src/lib` to access contract.

```sh
npm run deploy
```

4. Truffle can run tests written in Solidity or JavaScript against your smart contracts. Note the command varies slightly if you're in or outside of the development console.
  ```sh
  # If inside the development console.
  test

  # If outside the development console..
  truffle test

  # glue script
  npm run test
  ```

## Web development

Enter `web/` folder

1. Run the front-end hot reloading in `web/` (outside the truffle development console).
    ```sh
    // Serves the front-end on http://localhost:8080
    npm run start
    ```

2. Build the web project for production.

```sh
npm run build
```

3. Create-react-app can run tests within src/ folder.

```
npm run test
```

## What Does Truffle-React-Redux offer?

The `contracts/` sub project contain normal contracts and was bootstrapped with [truffle init](http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/project) command.

The `web/` sub project  was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and have pre-configured `React` and `Redux` basic settings with `react-router` and `react-intl`. You can access the blockchain via pre-configured redux `state.web3` (via [Ethjs](https://github.com/ethjs/ethjs)), or use `lib/web3utils` directly without redux state.

The template provide top level scripts so you can compile and deploy contracts via `npm run compile`, `npm run migrate` commands, or run the app in the development mode via `npm start` command without enter the sub project folders.

The glue scripts also help manage `contracts` and  `web` sub projects by install dependency modules and copy compiled JSON into `web/src/lib` for accessing contracts.
